In this team meeting we showed a basic prototype of the results screen to the rest of the team.
We all discussed the aesthetics and design of the results page as well as how we intend object to be passed in for parsing and displaying.
We then decided how we would split the work regrading changes.
Phillip, Marco & Alessio are initially assigned to re-organize the card/list layout.
Taylor & Kevin are initially assigned to input the checkbox options.
Joseph & Anders are initially assigned to research and implement some aesthetics regarding positioning and layout design.
