First Presentation Tuesday 11th October 2016:

Firstly, describe what we're trying to do generally.

What's the problem we're trying to address? (Taylor?)

What alternatives are out there? (Marco)

But our solution: long vs short term rent, and how it's going to be better

What features will it implement? Users ranking etc (Joseph)

Users? (Alessio)

How are we going to implement it? Very generally (Alessio?)



Report after presentation:
The TA (Sukwon) approved the idea, so we can get started on the project.
He also suggested implementing a (temporarily) 'fake' system for transaction processing.
Moreover, he suggested using flow-down diagrams/burn-down chart for organization within the team. 
Perhaps this chart could be implemented within the team management app 'Trello'?
