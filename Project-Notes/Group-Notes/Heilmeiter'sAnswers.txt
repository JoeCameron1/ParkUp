Heilmeter's Answers (Suggestion in the first tutorial.)

- What are you trying to do? 
  Solve the parking issue issue in downtown Toronto and produce a solution which is easy to access/use, usable just-in-time.

- How is it done today? Alternatives?
  Kijiji,  Craigslist.
  However, these services are only for long-term parking and they are not fast and easy to use.
  They do not solve the short term or 1/2 night parking issue.
  Also, our aim is to produce a prettier and more user-friendly UI.

- What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful? 
  It will be easier, faster, cheaper and allow short term notice to find parking spaces without having to have a monthly description or knowing the owner of the space for a long time. 
  Potential security-related issues were considered as well.
  That's why we will use an anonymous search circle that hides the addresses of lenders.
  We reckon it would be particularly successful/useful during specific events or holidays when the place will be crowded and easily run out of public parking lots available.

- Who cares? 
  Anyone that has an empty parking spot at any point of the day and anyone who is looking to rent a space for a cheaper price than regular street parking.
  Our aim here is to provide a platform where the excess demand for parking lots and the excess offer can easily meet.

- How many resources will it take? 
  4 core modules, a profile management, location, Scheduling manager for parking location and UI module.
