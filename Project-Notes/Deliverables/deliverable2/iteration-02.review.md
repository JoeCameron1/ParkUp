# ParkUp (project-team-07)

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 15th November 2016
 * Where: Bahen Centre for Information Technology - Room 3200

## Process - Reflection

#### Introduction

Reflecting upon our progress, we generally managed to maintain task allocation as stated in the iteration plan. The following reflection will describe the process details.

#### Development - Executive summary

After an initial setup of the server, running on Node and using Express for creating a handy REST API, development started and tasks were allocated following the structure specified in the iteration plan:

 * Joseph, Alessio and Anders took care of UI design and effectively created the html pages, implementing the main page interface using the Bootstrap library.
 * Phillip, Kevin, Marco and Taylor were responsible for backend functionalities.
 * Joseph, Marco and Taylor took care of Google Maps implementation and walking distance calculation.
 * Alessio provided a basic RESTFUL API extracting data from the server and parsing it to the list of results from map search.

#### Decisions turned out well:

Adopting GitHub as our task allocation tool turned out to be an extremely successful decision. When using GitHub's issues and projects, task allocation could be quickly accessed and viewed from within our repository in a Kanban-style environment, rather than having to adopt a separate tool. 

#### We are planning to make the following changes to our process:

Considering the productivity levels achieved by pair programming in the recent days compared to the initial stages of the iteration, we observed that group sessions were a better choice than Google Hangouts or long communications on Slack. Hence, adding an extra meeting on Friday and regularly meeting in Bahen allowed us to reach a greater team cohesion and significant improvements on the development side: pair programming and team consultation brought faster and more efficient production, rather than having to constantly update everybody on recent decisions.

Secondly, task allocation and splitting duties between frontend and backend development lead to more intense production due to the fact that each of us could apply their preferred skills, thus taking advantage of everybody's different background. In the end, the team was very satisfied with the functionalities implemented and the quality of the product achieved.

## Product - Review

#### Goals/tasks that were met/completed:
 
After drawing an initial paper mock-up, we managed to produce a working prototype running all the main pages and featuring all the principal functionalities. In particular, the following components were implemented: 

 * A UI theme was promptly created, making use of the Boostrap library, which allowed us to easily provide a good-looking dynamic user interface.

 * A fully functional component running Google Maps and featuring an interactive walking distance circle.
 
 * Booking Confirmation Pop-Ups were implemented at the bottom of the main page, once a user has selected its preferred choice.
 
 * A profile page was created, providing user information as well as previously rented parking spots and own spaces.
 
 * Additionally, we created an about page providing essential information about the app.

#### Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

The initial plan to implement payment processing was postponed to a later development stage since it was regarded as non fundamental feature.

#### (Optional) Goals/tasks that were not originally planned, but ended up being met/completed:

We opted to produce some templating files with EJS, which would allow us to efficiently and neatly developing all the application pages.
