# ParkUp (project-team-07)

## Iteration 02

 * Start date: November 4th 2016
 * End date: November 15th 2016

## Process

#### Introduction

Our first priority for this iteration is to efficiently merge the team with the new members, by newly exposing the project to everyone and assign roles. As part of it, we are planning to benefit from the merge by achieving a higher work effectiveness and extend the scope of our goals for the project. As for what concerns product development, we will split the tasks of developing the main frontend and backend functionalities, with the aim of producing a working prototype by the end of the this iteration.

#### Roles & responsibilities

***Alessio Brozzi @alessiobrozzi1: Team Manager*** - Supervise the overall working pace of the team, make sure every team member takes part in the project equally, facilitate communications and give space to everybody's suggestions/ideas, responsible for the harmonious progress of different aspects of the project, from product design to technical development.

***Joseph Cameron @JoeCameron1: Product Manager & UX/UI Lead*** - Responsible for all aspects related to the product, user experience (UX), overall functionality, specific features and added value for the end-user.

***Marco Martin @marcoemartin: Technical Lead*** - Sharing knowledge on backend development, explaining optimal design patterns, supervising the merge process on the master branch. Master of the Integration Process.

***Taylor Stinson @tayloryeow: Research Coordinator*** - Will coordinate and designate research of various team members. Ensure that each team member has enough information to integrate their responsibility pieces with each other.

***Kevin Kwong @kevin-kc: Front-End Developer*** - Responsible for the harmonious working of the user interface, spanning from html features to event-handling.

***Phillip Nguyen @nguyenphillip: Back-End Developer*** - In charge of creating and managing all the logistics of the application which include responsibilities such as database management and data parsing. 

***Anders Leung @anders-leung: Front-End Developer*** - Will regularly improve the user interface in conjunction with Joseph and Taylor.

On a general note, each member will work as a developer on the project, under the supervision of the whole team.

#### Events
 
Following on from the last deliverable, we continued to schedule weekly meetings every Wednesday from 4-6pm. However, we unanimously decided that one weekly meeting was not enough to effectively communicate new ideas. Therefore, we added an additional 2 hour meeting every Friday from 4-6pm. The Wednesday meeting will be our main opportunity to discuss what every team member is working on, which jobs have been started/completed, and which new features must still be implemented. Furthermore, this meeting will also allow the opportunity for every team member to suggest improvements to the project or to comment on the team's overall working pace. The Friday meeting will be used as our main development meeting, where all team members will code together. We introduced this in order to prevent members from straying off track during the development stage. We previously found that coding individually all the time can cause confusion between our team members when trying to implement features. As for quicker non-scheduled meetings, we will be using Google Hangouts, so that all team members will have an easy way of contacting the others regarding specific issues. Slack is our communication channel for branching conversations on different topics/tasks. Phone calls will be a constant throughout the development process for quick check-ins.

#### Artefacts

Trello is the tool we are using for general task allocation between team members, meaning we are going to create and allocate general non-technical tasks to team members through Trello in a virtual Kanban environment that each team member can access anywhere. Jobs will be assigned following a communal decision procedure while trying to meet everybody's knowledge, skills and preferences. Furthermore, we decided to make more intense use of GitHub Issues, defining the content of our projects and working as a notification system and allocate team members using the integrated allocation tool.

When implementing features for our application, we will use git branching. Team members will work on separate branches and each of them will correspond to the development of one individual feature. Once a feature has been correctly implemented, the branch corresponding to that feature will be merged to the master branch and deleted from the repository.


## Product

#### Goals and tasks:
 
Our main goal for this second iteration is to create a basic user interface for our web application. This will include:

 * Main Activity: loaded once the application is ready, will feature a map at the centre of the screen, allowing the user to modify the scope of the search, with links to a list of available parking lots and related reviews.
 * Results Activity: it features a list of available lots, with information on price and reviews.
 * Booking Activity: once the user has selected their preferred option, they can proceed with booking it.
 * Profile Activity: it displays profile related information and it is linked to the other activities through a dropdown menu.

Backend functionalities will be limited to the essentials, in order to focus on producing a prototype to show at the end of this iteration.

Development will mainly focus around two areas: all frontend functionalities related to results, profile and booking activities will be covered by Joseph, Anders, and Kevin, while Alessio, Phillip, Marco and Taylor will be assigned to implement the necessary backend functionality and the main activity.
    
As for what regards individual assignments:

 * Alessio, Joseph, Phillip, Anders & Kevin will be responsible for implementing the User Interface, Payment Processing & Booking Confirmation. Also responsible for bringing the user experience to life.
 * Alessio, Joseph, Marco and Taylor will be working on implementing Google Maps on the main page, with which we can search and display a shaded circle, visually representing the walking time distance.

Each team member will have to bring contributions during meetings in terms of ideas to consider. Furthermore, each of us will be responsible to implement certain basic features relevant to our roles as well as help on development outside their assignments. The team will then critically evaluate the functionality and usability of the overall application on a consistent basis, with the goal of further improving the application.


#### Artefacts

By the end of this iteration, we plan to re-design our old mock-ups as well as create a new user interface that appears consistent over all of our application's activities: this characteristic will allow the user to easily get familiar with our UI. Joseph, Alessio and Anders are going to be directly responsible for drawing the mockups, and sharing them with the whole team to gain a more critical insight.
