## Process

Introduction

As an abstract to our first iteration plan, we are going to describe how we will be planning our team work, what artefacts we will be using as part of the management process, then concluding with the tasks we are going to set for this iteration, together with the goals and achievements we expect to attain.

#### Roles & responsibilities

Alessio Brozzi: Team Manager - Supervise the overall working pace of the team, make sure every team member takes part in the project equally, facilitate communications and give space to everybody's suggestions/ideas, responsible for the harmonious progress of different aspects of the project, from product design to technical development.

Joseph Cameron: Product Manager - Responsible for all aspects related to the product, user experience (UX), overall functionality, specific features and added value for the end-user.

Marco Martin: Technical Lead - Sharing knowledge on backend development, explaining optimal design patterns, supervising the merge process on the master branch. Master of the Integration Process.

Taylor Stinson: Research Coordinator - Will coordinate and designate research of various team members. Ensure that each team member has enough information to integrate their responsibility pieces with each other.

On a general note, each member will work as a developer on the project, under the supervision of the whole team. 

#### Events

We scheduled a weekly meeting every Wednesday from 4-6pm: this meeting will be our main opportunity for a general catch-up on what every member is working on, which jobs have been started/completed, which new features we'll have to implement. Also during this meeting everyone will have an opportunity to suggest improvements to the project or to comment on the team overall working pace.
As for quicker non-scheduled meetings, we will be using Google Hangouts, so that all team members will have an easy way of contacting the others regarding specific issues.
Moreover, we've also set-up a communication channel on Slack for branching conversations on different topics/tasks. Phone calls will be a constant throughout the development process for quick check-ins. 

#### Artefacts
 
We will be building to-do lists and burn-down charts to organize the project into broad categories (frontend, backend..) and each of them into specific sections and jobs to be completed as well as features to be implemented. Each of these services will be signed up with a project specific gmail account.

We're going to use Trello as a responsibility management tool to create and allocate tasks to the team members. Jobs will be assigned following a communal decision procedure and trying to meet everybody's knowledge, skills and preferences.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks:

Our main goal for the first iteration is to brainstorm around our opportunity set of projects to choose. Each team member will have to bring a contribution to the first meetings in terms of ideas to consider: furthermore, each of us will be responsible to research similar products currently in use, together with a general layout of the requirements and characteristics the product will need. The team will then critically consider the ideas and rank them according to their feasibility, user utility, skills required, learning possibilities and general interest of the team.
Once a decision has been made, the team will assess all possible issues and obstacles the development will bring, as to gather a preliminary knowledge of how to address the development in the first stages and which areas deserve more concern.

#### Artefacts:
   
Artefacts that are to be made
    Deliverable tracking sheet
        Google sheets sheet to quantify and coordinate what items are left to do for Deliverable 1. 
        To be replaced with google keep.         
        
    Initial UI mockup
        Once the idea is selected, we will discuss of how our final design will look like. The design
        will be inspired by different products (website and applications) already on the market and our own creativity!

    Personas
        Create a few persona profiles of potential users.
        From these we will select which users will be our main targets and we will shape our 
        design according to it.
    
    Scenarios
        We are going to simulate possible scenarios where our application will benefit our selected user 
        personas, in order to identify the added value the product will bring.
        
    Prototype mock-up
        A general description of the layout the application will have, including server-side,
        front-end and how they will interact.
