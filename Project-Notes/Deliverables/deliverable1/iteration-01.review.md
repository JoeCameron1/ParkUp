# ParkUp (project-team-07)

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

When: Review Meeting Occurred 26/10/16 - Wednesday the 26th of October

Where: BA3200 - Great Hall of Computing

## Process - Reflection

#### Introduction

This iteration has been defined as a process of coming together. Each team member had a group of ideas we wanted to put forward and only over time we began to aggregate to the current idea. Namely: a shared-economy personal parking space rental web application. In the spirit of coming together we have also began to sync our schedules together and began to firm up our communication methods. Our Slack communication channel, originally rarely used, has seen more frequent use recently. Additionally we have become used to our weekly meetings and multiple group members are working together on projects for different classes, bringing important additional know-how to our team work. We have begun to successfully meet the decided deadlines.

#### Decisions that turned out well:
 
Roles assignment to team members:
Appointing four different roles to the team members allowed us to effectively cover all the areas to be targeted and issued to be tailored. As a matter of fact, we adequately met the main goals on our iteration plan, with every team member fulfilling their duties and providing the team with useful resources to everybody's work.

Weekly meeting on Wednesday 4-6 in BA3200 (Great Hall):
From our commit log it can be seen that we have made good use of our weekly meeting time. 4-6 is a time we are all active and up on campus as well as one where we are all done for the day and are not too tired. It is traditionally where we set tone for the following week. 

Slack as a communication method:
Our communications are easily parsable and team members are easy to get in touch with, as it allows us to cover each other and stay connected, keeping track of the developments on the different topics discussed.

#### We are planning to make the following changes to our process:

As the development process starts and we lay down the different target areas and features to implement, we are planning to boost the development so that we can get a prototype version of the web app running and we can gain a better understanding of the technical requirements and timings needed.

#### Decisions to be tested yet:

We still have not started using Trello as a team management tool, as development duties have yet to be assigned. We will commence proper development during the next iteration, during which we will branch requirements and inaugurate Trello.


## Product - Review

#### Goals/tasks that were met/completed:
 
Brainstorming possible project ideas was effectively completed on our second meeting. We narrowed to the following bracket of feasible projects: an app suggesting the user restaurants and cafes filtered according to various criteria including a specials menu, a browser extension aiding file compression, a phonetic keyboard matcher for the Egyptian alphabet and a shared-economy app for renting private parking lots. Critically considering the above list of attainable ideas, we finally agreed on opting for the shared-economy app for parking lots and we decided to call it 'ParkUp'.

Joseph and Alessio conducted research on the products already on the market (available in the folder "Examples-of-Similar-Apps"), identifying the best performing services and areas of improvement.

Joseph took responsibility for User Personas design (working on his suggestion of simulating scenarios in order to picture possible user added value and inspect demand). The links for the personas are below:

Marco performed technical analysis of the possible project layouts, then suggesting the decision to create a web app, with the main application running on a central server.

Joseph and Marco worked on User Cases and Scenarios. The link to the user cases/scenarios is below:

Joseph, Alessio and Taylor then produced a few mock-ups for the UI (available in the folder "Mockups"), with the aid of the team suggestions and layouts of the products on the market.

#### Goals/tasks that were not originally planned, but ended up being met/completed:

At the end of the iteration, we discussed the features the app will have (available in the "notes" folder in the "IdeasBucket" file) as to improve the UI mockups and establish a basis upon which we can lead the next iteration.

#### Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

Perform detailed technical analysis of the project requirements.
Finalize design of the app backend, UI and their interaction.
Review UI mockups and improve UI tailoring them specifically to the User Personas.
Branch main development areas into specific tasks to be assigned to team members.
Undertake development, commencing from the frontend.
