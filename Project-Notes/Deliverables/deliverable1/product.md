# ParkUp (project-team-07)

#### What are we planning to build?

We are planning to build a web app that allows users to both rent and lend a private parking space (or many spaces) in congested cities where parking is expensive. The app would match prospective customers to parking spaces that would accommodate them. The usage of the app would involve the following process: the renter would search a parking lot filtering according to their preferred zone, price range and size of the car. They would then be able to select a space from the map; confirming the selection would send a push notification to the lender who, after reviewing the renters profile would decide if they want to proceed with the proposition or not. 


#### Who are our target users?

Our application would target two main users:
   1. People that are looking for parking spaces for a cheaper price than public spaces for both long and short terms
   2. People that are looking to rent out a private space/parking lot in order to make an extra profit from unused private property.
   
   We have made two user personas to represent our target users.
   The links to each user persona are below:
   
   Paul Woods (Represents Category 1 above) : https://app.xtensio.com/folio/m3pbwiwq
   Paul Woods is a middle-aged investment banker who works in downtown Toronto. He commutes into Toronto's financial district every day and is looking for a better, faster, more-convenient and cheaper parking solution.
   
   Sarah McKingsley (Represents Category 2 above) : https://app.xtensio.com/folio/qtfsvulv
   Sarah McKingsley is a retired business owner who regularly spends her time travelling to foreign countries. Hence, her driveway located at her house just outside Toronto's bustling downtown area is regularly empty. However, Sarah feels her space could make her some additional cash and help out some people looking for parking spots in the city. So she wants a way to securely communicate with potential commuters.

#### Why would our users choose our product? What are they using today to solve their problem?

Our product would create an easy-to-use environment where users can find and reserve spaces more conveniently and at cheaper prices than public parking. 

It will provide a safe platform to establish connections between renters and lenders where users looking to rent would be able to choose their lenders (and vice versa) according to their ratings: ratings will be established from a history of previous user experiences with that user.

Originally, the web app did not include a user rating system. However, we realized that the user rating system would provide a more attractive and safer/regulated environment, where users could rely on a positive history of reviews as a form of insurance when deciding what users to rent to or rent from.

Furthermore, the first version was meant for long term parking (i.e. monthly rent or when a user constantly needs to rent out a spot for their trip to work). After realizing the potential of having short term parking as a feature we decided to build an app targeting both those users who would use it to find a long term spot to which they can "subscribe" and those renters who are looking for on-the-fly spots, for instance needing a parking lot in a congested area within a couple of hours.

Currently people with the same issue (looking for cheaper parking spots) would go to CraigsList or Kijiji and create a post to rent a space. However, this process is long and tedious, mainly because of the anonymity of the users, which leads to the entire platform being unsafe, and the fact that those apps service general purposes and are not specifically designed to target the problem of renting out unused private parking lots.
However, considering the market potential of this service, some startups are already producing similar prototypes and mvps to our app. Even though a few applications are already on the App Store/Google Play (eg. HonkMobile) or web-based (eg. WhereiPark), they still have to spread among the greater public needs and constitute early versions of the product. On our side, we are going to construct our own product following our specific goals in terms of end-user and preferred features, and targeting the issues those apps leave unsolved: as the development process will evolve, we will be better inspect the applications on the market and be able to understand them better both from developer and a user perspective.
